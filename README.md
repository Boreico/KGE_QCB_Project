# Knowledge Graph Engineering Project
The purpose of this project is the creation of a system that enables users to explore the transmission dynamics of the human microbiome together with various social interactions and environmental elements that can affect it. It is done by also supporting comparative analysis (ex. different bacterial populations present in different samples) and exhibits key transmission patterns,
highlighting the influence of factors such as cohabitation and geographic location on microbial
diversity and bacterial phenotypes. The resulting Knowledge Graph will be used to embed both
the information about microbiome species shared between individuals, the phenotypic information of the transmitted microbial species and the information about the social relationships
between the considered individuals.
