# Knowledge Graph Engineering Project
The purpose of this project is the creation of a system that enables users to explore the trans-
mission dynamics of the human microbiome together with various social interactions and envi-
ronmental elements that can affect it. It is done by also supporting comparative analysis (ex. dif-
ferent bacterial populations present in different samples) and exhibits key transmission patterns,
highlighting the influence of factors such as cohabitation and geographic location on microbial
diversity and bacterial phenotypes. The resulting Knowledge Graph will be used to embed both
the information about microbiome species shared between individuals, the phenotypic infor-
mation of the transmitted microbial species and the information about the social relationships
between the considered individuals.
